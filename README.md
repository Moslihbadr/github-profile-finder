# github-profile-finder

This is a simple web app that allows users to search for a GitHub user and retrieve information about their profile and repositories.

## How to Use

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Enter the username of the GitHub user you want to search for in the search bar.
2. Click the "Search" button or press the Enter key.
3. If the user is found, their profile information will be displayed, along with a list of their 10 most starred repositories.
4. If the user is not found, an error message will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

This app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve information about users and their repositories.

## Code Overview

The JavaScript code uses the `fetch()` method to make API requests to the GitHub API. It retrieves the user's profile information and their 10 most starred repositories. If the user is not found or an error occurs, an appropriate message is displayed.

The HTML and CSS code are used to create the structure and styling of the app.

## Future Improvements

In the future, the app could be improved by adding more functionality, such as the ability to search for repositories or view information about individual commits.
